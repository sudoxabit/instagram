- **User Confirmation and Process Cancellation**: Includes user confirmation dialogs and the option to cancel the process at any step.
- **Optimized Message Timing**: Adjustable timing for smoother interaction with Instagram, reducing the risk of rate limits.
- **Guided Instructions**: Provides easy-to-follow pop-up instructions to guide users through the messaging process.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Double-click the `.vbs` file to start the script.
2. **Enter Message Content**:
   - Enter the first line of the message in the input prompt.
   - For additional lines, follow the prompts to add more lines. Leave the input blank when done.
3. **Set Message Count**: Enter the number of times you want the message to be sent.
4. **Confirmation**: A confirmation message will display; proceed if details are correct.
5. **Open Instagram DM**: The script automatically opens Instagram Direct Messages in the default browser.

   Hello! This is a message from XABIT.
   Line 2 of the message.
   Thank you for your support!
   ```

The script will send the above message five times to the selected Instagram DM recipient.

## Setup
